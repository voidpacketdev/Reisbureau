<h1>Personal data we collect and process</h1>
<p class="title-text">Personal data you give to us</p>
<p>
    When you make a trip reservation, you are (at minimum) asked for your name and email address. Depending on the nature of the trip reservation, we may also need to ask for your home address, phone number, payment info, date of birth, current location (in the case of on-demand services), whether you’re traveling for work purposes, the names and dates of birth of the people traveling with you, and any preferences you might have for your trip (e.g. dietary or accessibility requirements). For reservations for flights and certain attractions, we may be required to ask you for additional information including your and your co-travelers’ passport or national ID information. This may also be necessary for online check-in.

    When you contact our customer service team, contact your trip provider through our platform or reach out to us in a different way (e.g. through social media), we also collect information from you via these channels including metadata such as for calls, who you are, where you called from, and the date and length of the call.

    When you search using our platform for possible trip reservations, you can select to save specific trip items in a list that we’ll store for you. During or after your trip, we may also invite you to submit reviews that can inform others about the experiences you had on your trip. When you submit reviews on the platform, we collect information you’ve included along with your first name or display name and avatar (if you choose one).

    If you create a user account on our platform, we also store information you include and manage in that user account. This can include personal settings, credit card information, uploaded photos, and your reviews. You can also choose to add to your user account details from one or more of your identification documents so you don't have to re-enter this information for future trip reservations. The data kept in your user account can help you plan and manage future trip reservations and personalized recommendations.

    There are other circumstances where you’ll provide us with personal data. For example, if you’re using our platform from your mobile device, you can decide to allow Booking.com to use your current location or grant us access to some other details. This helps us give you the best possible service and experience by, for example, suggesting the nearest restaurants or attractions to your location or making other recommendations.
</p>
<p class="title-text">Personal data you give us about others</p>
<p>
    It may be that you use our platform to make a trip reservation on behalf of, or that involves, other travelers. In this case, you may be required to provide some details about these persons as part of the trip reservation. If you have a Booking.com for Business account, you can keep an address book there to make it easier to plan and manage business travel arrangements for others.

    In some cases, you might use Booking.com to share information with others. This can take the form of sharing a list of saved items for example.

    When you use the platform to share information about others, it’s your responsibility to ensure that each person you provide personal data about is aware that you’re doing so and understands how Booking.com uses their personal data (as described in this privacy statement).
</p>
<p class="title-text">Personal data we collect automatically</p>
<p>
    Whether or not you make a trip reservation, when you use our websites or mobile apps, we automatically collect certain information. This includes your IP address, the dates and times of using our platform and selected information about your device’s hardware and software (e.g. operating system, internet browser, mobile app version, language settings). When you are redirected by a third-party website or mobile app to a Booking.com website or mobile app, we collect this as well. We also collect information about clicks you make and which pages are shown to you from our platform, for example, via the cookies we drop.

    When you use our mobile apps, we collect data that identifies the mobile device as well as data about the operation (including possible crashes) of the app on that device.
</p>
<p class="title-text">Personal data we receive from other sources</p>
<p>
    We may also receive information about you from other sources. This can include one or more of the following:

    Other BHI companies
    Trip providers, for example as part of their interactions with our customer services
    Strategic partners we contract with
    Other third-party companies such as marketing partners
    Information we receive from these parties may be used together with information you provide us with directly via our platform for the purposes of providing services to you.

    We receive personal data about you from these parties in situations such as those listed here:

    Our trip reservation services are not only made available directly on our websites and mobile apps. They are also integrated into the services of strategic partners you can find online. When you make a reservation online using a service for which the strategic partner relies on Booking.com, we receive the reservation details via the strategic partner so that your reservation can be processed and supported.
    Trip providers may share information about you with Booking.com too. This could happen if you have support questions about a pending trip reservation, or if disputes or other issues arise about a trip reservation.
    We integrate with third-party payment service providers such as Adyen and Stripe to, for example, facilitate electronic payments between you, Booking.com, and trip providers. These service providers share payment information so we can administer and handle your trip reservation.
    In some cases, we link to other business partners providing trip reservations that may not be available on our website or mobile apps. When you click on these, you’re redirected to other business partners’ websites, where you can make a reservation. These partners may share certain personal data related to your specific reservation and your interactions on these websites or mobile apps with us in accordance with their privacy policies.
    Our platform includes communication services such as email and chat messages. These communication services offer you a convenient way to contact the trip provider you’ve booked with to discuss specifics of your reservation such as available parking at an accommodation. The data we collect and process includes these communications. We may block the delivery of communications that we, at our sole discretion, believe might contain malicious content or spam, or pose a risk to you, trip providers, Booking.com, or others.
    We may also receive information (e.g. the additional cookie data our social media and marketing partners may make available to us on an aggregated basis) in order for us to measure the effectiveness of advertising and marketing campaigns.
    When you link your Booking.com user account to a social media account you control, you might trigger exchanges of data between Booking.com and that social media provider. You can always choose to unlink your Booking.com user account by updating your Booking.com user account settings and preferences.
    We collect information in the regrettable case that we receive a complaint about you from a trip provider, for example in the case of possible misconduct.
