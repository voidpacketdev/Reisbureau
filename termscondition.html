<h1>Terms And Condition</h1>
<h2>1.0. Our Platform</h2>
<ol>
    <li>We get information from Service Providers, and we can’t guarantee that everything is accurate—but when providing our Platform, we take reasonable care and act with professional diligence. Unless we’ve failed to do so, or have been negligent, we can’t be held responsible for any errors, interruptions, or missing bits of information. Of course, we’ll do everything we can to correct/fix them as soon as we become aware of them.</li>

    <li>We’re always working to improve our customers’ experience with Booking.com. So sometimes, we show different people different designs, phrasings, products, etc. to find out how they react. As a result, you might not come across some services or conditions when you visit our Platform.</li>

    <li>Our Platform is not a recommendation or endorsement of any Service Provider or its products, services, facilities, vehicles, etc.</li>

    <li>We’re not a party to the terms between you and the Service Provider. The Service Provider is solely responsible for the Travel Experience.</li>

    <li>To make a Booking, you may need to create an Account. Make sure all your info (including payment and contact details) is correct and up to date, or you might not be able to access your Travel Experience(s). You’re responsible for anything that happens with your Account, so don’t let anyone else use it and keep your username and password secret.</li>

    <li>We’ll show you the offers that are available to you, in (what we think is) the right language for you. You can change to another language whenever you like.</li>

    <li>Unless otherwise indicated, you need to be at least 18 to use the Platform.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2.0. Prices</h2>
<ol>
    <li>When you make a Booking, you agree to pay the cost of the Travel Experience, including any taxes and charges that may apply.</li>

    <li>Some of the prices you see may have been rounded to the nearest whole number. The price you pay will be based on the original, “non-rounded” price (although the actual difference will be tiny anyway).</li>

    <li>Obvious errors and obvious misprints are not binding. For example, if you book a premium car or a night in a luxury suite that was mistakenly offered for $1, your booking may be canceled and we’ll refund anything you’ve paid.</li>

    <li>A crossed-out price indicates the price of a like-for-like Booking without the price reduction applied (“like-for-like” means same dates, same policies, same quality of accommodation/vehicle/class of travel, etc.).</li>
</ol>
<h2>3.0. Policies</h2>
<ol>
    <li>When you make a Booking, you accept the applicable policies as displayed in the booking process. You’ll find each Service Provider’s cancellation policy and any other policies (about age requirements, security/damage deposits, additional supplements for group Bookings, extra beds, breakfast, pets, cards accepted, etc.) on our Platform: on the Service Provider information pages, during the booking process, in the fine print, and in the confirmation email or ticket (if applicable).</li>

    <li>If you cancel a Booking or don’t show up, any cancellation/no-show fee or refund will depend on the Service Provider’s cancellation/no-show policy.</li>

    <li>Some Bookings can’t be canceled for free, while others can only be canceled for free before a deadline.</li>

    <li>If you book a Travel Experience by paying in advance (including all price components and/or a damage deposit if applicable), the Service Provider may cancel the Booking without notice if they can’t collect the balance on the date specified. If they do cancel, any non-refundable payment you’ve made will only be refunded at their discretion. It’s your responsibility to make sure the payment goes through on time, that your bank, debit card, or credit card details are correct, and that there’s enough money available in your account.</li>

    <li>If you think you’re not going to arrive on time, contact your Service Provider and tell them when they can expect you. It’s your responsibility to ensure you’re on time—and if you aren’t, we are not responsible for any associated costs (e.g. the cancellation of your Booking, or any fees the Service Provider may charge).</li>

    <li>As the person making the Booking, you are responsible for the actions and behavior (in relation to the Travel Experience) of everyone in the group. You’re also responsible for obtaining their permission before providing us with their personal data.</li>
